## Overview

The Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam equation is formulated in several equivalent forms and solved via:

1. **Direct PINN Solution**  
   - PINN solves the boundary-value problem.  
   - Results are benchmarked against a classical FEM solver.  
   - FEM, optimized for linear engineering systems, outperforms the PINN in speed and accuracy.

2. **Inverse PINN for Elastic Modulus Estimation**  
   - Synthetic deflection measurements are used.  
   - Two PINNs infer the unknown Youngâ€™s modulus by fitting deflection data.  
   - With careful hyperparameter tuning, the PINNs achieve highly accurate modulus estimates.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haasrobertgmxnet/BeamEquation.git
cd BeamEquation/BeamBending

# Optional: create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Direct PINN vs FEM comparison

```bash
py Beam.Python.py --mode direct
```

or

```bash
python Beam.Python.py --mode direct
```
This script trains the PINN, solves the beam deflection, and compares results to FEM.

### 2. Inverse PINN for Youngâ€™s Modulus Estimation

```bash
py Parameteridentification.Python.py --mode inverse
```

or

```bash
python Parameteridentification.Python.py --mode inverse
```

This runs the inverse PINN workflow, estimating Youngâ€™s modulus from synthetic deflection data.

## Results Summary

- **Direct PINN vs FEM**: FEM achieves greater accuracy and computation speed in solving forward boundary-value problems.
- **Inverse PINN**: The data-driven PINN approach precisely recovers Youngâ€™s modulus when properly tuned, demonstrating effectiveness for parameter estimation.
